# What is Machine Learning? <br>

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. 
<h3>Arthur Samuel described it as:</h3> "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition. <br>

<h3>Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition:</h3> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." <br>

<strong>Example: playing checkers.</strong>

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

# What is Machine Learning? ðŸ¤–

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. 
  
ðŸ’¨ <strong>Arthur Samuel described it as:</strong> "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition. <br>

ðŸ’¨ <strong>Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition:</strong> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." <br><br>

<h3>Example: playing checkers.</h3> 

<h4>E = the experience of playing many games of checkers <br></h4>
<h4>T = the task of playing checkers. </h4>
<h4>P = the probability that the program will win the next game. </h4>

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
